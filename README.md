## Abstract Proposal

FIRST STEP: Write up a description (in the form of an abstract) of what you will revisit for your final project. This should be one paragraph clearly describing your concept and approach. What are your desired creative goals? How are you expanding on something we covered in the class? How will you present your work next Wednesday in the final project presentations? 

** Answer **
Expanding on the previous project, I trained 5 different cycleGAN networks of subsets of the william blake images curated from before. The end goal is to take an input image and stylize it to william blake, but this will be achieved through various methods: run through multiple subsets, one subset. The input images (validation set) will be a famous paintings and generated images from another pretrained model. The models I use to stylize, though, will all be trained by me.

## Project Report

Upload your project report (4 pages) as a pdf with your repository, following this template: [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133H59WZBmH6MlAgFSskFLMQITeIC5d9b2iuzsOfa4E8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- What you include here will very much depend on the format of your final project
  - image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
  - 3d models
  - movie files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
  - audio files
  - ... some other form

## Technical Notes

The trained models, along with their python notebook, are provided in the links below because of the large file size. The format is h5 for the weights and json for the network architecture. Each are about 500 MB each and are compressed into tar files.
